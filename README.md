ShapeDB - Indexed molecular shape search.

Building
========
The project is built using Eclipse.  Auto-generated makefiles can be found
in the Release directory.  You will likely have to edit these.

Usage
=====

*Important:*  Conformations are stored using the provided coordinates.
You must provide molecular conformations aligned to your desired frame of reference.
There are python scripts in the scripts directory to assist with aligning to
a canonical frame of reference (as done with VAMS) or to fragments (FOMS).

### Building a database
```
ShapeDB -Create -in selfaligned_actives_f.sdf -db foo.db
```

### Searching a database
Similarity search:
```
ShapeDB -NNSearch -k 3  -ligand salig.pdb -db foo.db -print -single-conformer -out hits.sdf
```
Distance constrain search:
```
ShapeDB -DCSearch -less 2.0 -more 2.0 -ligand salig.sdf -receptor sarec.pdb -db foo.db -print -single-conformer -out hits.sdf
```


```
